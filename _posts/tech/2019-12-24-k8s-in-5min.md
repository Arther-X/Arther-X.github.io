Hi my name is Pete Aguilar 
I'm a director of technical product management here at VMware 
in our cloud native apps business unit 
and this lightboard session is all about giving kubernetes to you in five minutes 
and it's going to be a little bit of a challenge 
so I'm going to have to brush over a lot of detailed concepts in kubernetes 
but I want to give you a rough idea of what is it and what does it actually do 
and what is it responsible for 
so there's a few different architectural components two of which I'm going to talk about 

the first of which is the kubernetes cluster services 
and you know the fundamental premise behind kubernetes is that 
we can enforce what's called desired state management 
and really what that means is that I'm going to feed the cluster services a specific configuration 
and it will be up to the cluster services to go out 
and run that configuration in my infrastructure okay 
one of the main components that I do want to call out is this API that sits in front of all this in the API services 
so that is one building block of the system 

the second building block of the system is this thing called a worker 
and what is a worker 
well a worker is really just a container host the one thing unique about a worker 
or the container host in a kubernetes environment is that 
it does have this cubelet process that runs which is responsible for communicating with yes you guessed it the kubernetes cluster services 
and so this whole thing the cluster services the workers themselves that's what makes up this quote/unquote kubernetes cluster 
so let's talk about the use case here 
so in this case what we want to do is we want to feed this the configuration 
so the desired state so to speak exist here in a deployment yeah file 
so here I'm just going to call it application one dot yeah Mille 
and inside this there can be a whole bunch of configuration information 

I am going to bypass quite a bit of it 
but I am going to talk about two fundamental pieces 

the first of which in this deployment file is a pod configuration 
in a pod is like the smallest unit of deployment in kubernetes in terms of the kubernetes object model 
and what it means is that in a pod I can have running containers 
and you can have one or more 
so in order to run that pod I need to specify some sort of container image 
maybe I want to have two container images and further down the line 

there's other things like what TCP port 
and where services running or whatnot 
but the other additional thing is that I'm going to specify how many of these pods need to be running here 
so maybe there's three for pod number one I can also list additional pod so here's pod leaves different color 
so pod number two and I basically have container image number three 
and then replicas off my configuration file equal to two 
so what happens I will take this deployment file 
I will feed it to the API and it will bit up 
it will be up to the cluster services to figure out how to schedule these pods in the environment 
and make sure that I have the right number of pods running 
so I feed this file over here let's work on pod one 
so I'm going to have pod one replica one pod one replica two pod one replicas three in addition I've also got my pod two 
so here we are pod two replica one 
and in this case we only have two replicas here so let's just do pod one replica two here 
and so you can see at any point in time the cluster services are responsible to make sure that configuration is running across all of my container or my workers 
so what is what's a unique scenario that happens here what happens if I lose a worker now my running configuration 
because that pot is now dead 
my running configuration does not match this 
and it's up to the kubernetes cluster services through the cubelet process that's running to notify me of that 
and to understand what's actually running 

so what I've done is I actually drop this pod one replica to 
so therefore the scheduler has to make a scheduling decision on where I need to instantiate that 
so it will just pick one of the workers whoops that will be pod one 
and in this case this is replica two 

so this is kind of the basics of kubernetes in five minutes 
hope you enjoyed it stay tuned for more light board sessions on the subject of kubernetes with photon platform 
thanks you
